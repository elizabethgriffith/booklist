# booklist-application
An application to track books read. Information included are the title, author, genre, and personal rating.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Skeleton

This app was made using vanilla JavaScript to take in the inputs from a form, store them in local storage, and add them to a list. The main components of the JavaScript are the use of ES6 classes. Using classes allowed for easy input and storage of objects, and the ability to update the UI with different class methods. Class methods were also used for manipulating local storage.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I learned from building this application was how to use classes to effectively store information as objects. By creating a book constructor I was able to easily fill in the table with the books' information without having to rewrite code or use loops. The use of ES6 classes as opposed to older object constructors made the code much cleaner and easier to read and helped me effectively organize my JavaScript in a way that was understandable.

This application also helped build on my knowledge of parent/sibling relationships and how to target different elements of the DOM using them. Using a parent relationship allowed me to insert a message into the DOM in the correct place. I am continuing to solidify my understanding and application of DOM manipulation by creating elements, adding their classes and text nodes, and appending them to their parent elements.
